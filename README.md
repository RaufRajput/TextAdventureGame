 <h3 align="center">The project that united six students from reality to dreams about a perfect smurfville</h3>
<p align="center">
 School project made by six students who met on a dark and cold tuesday on the 3rd of december 2019
 to collaborate on a text adventure game. Our creativity and illusion led us to a fictional
 story about smurfs and monsters and soon after that our idea of "Monster Punch" came to life.
